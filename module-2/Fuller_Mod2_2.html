  <h2> Chapter 1 - Author</h2>

 <p class="intro" >I currently reside in Omaha, Nebraska. The city of Omaha is a mid-sized city in the heart of the country. It is surrounded by small towns and agricultural areas. Omaha has a growing technical climate with large companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.</p>

 <p>  <SPAN class=sentencec> My hobbies are continuing my technical education in data engineering and data science.</SPAN> I also am active in a running club. Volunteering at a local shelter is also a hobby.</p>

 <p>My favorite places to vacation are by seaside. Locations have included Ft Lauderdale, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Francisco, California. My vacations usually include seeing the local sites, and visiting many state park and recreational areas.</p>

 <p>I am an avid reader. I subscribe to many newspapers, including the Washington Post and the New York Times. My favorite magazines include the New Yorker, the Atlantic, National Geographic, and Vanity Fair. I also read books recommended by Kirkus Reviews and the New York Times.</p>
